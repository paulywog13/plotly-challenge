# plotly-homework-challenge
The goal of this challenge was to use JavaScript and Plotly coding to read in the data of a json file containing data on bacteria found in the belly buttons of a group of test subjects and to dispay the information on an html website. The website needed include a dropdown menu and 4 different types of plotly charts that would need to be updated with new test subject information and each time a new test subject is chosen from the menu. 

Files included in this challenge: samples.json, app.js, index.html, style.css

Languages used: JavaScript, CSS, HTML

My main takeaway from this challenge is that using JavaScript and Plotly graphs are great tools for processing and presenting data in so that it can be displayed in a easy to read and understand format. I enjoyed learning and working with a variety of Plotly graphing and chart styles and it helped me to understand how and why different graphs would be used for different sets of data.

The bubble chart was my favorite chart to create as it was fun working with the different color palettes to see how to best display the data. I like that I was able to display the unique OTU ID below the x axis at the bottom of the bubble chart when cursor hovers over each specific bubble while displaying the OTU labels and values on the bubble.  

The gauge was by far the hardest chart to create and took the most time to research as we did not cover this type of chart in class. I found a variety of guage chart options but very few included a pointer. I thought it was cool to be able to use a little trigonometry to calculate the pointer movements and I need to do some more independent research to fully understand the path information for the pointer shape.
